Flashcards
==========

A simple way to get the computer to do the task of flashcard testing for you.

Currently supports:

   - Sample size testing (question count)
   - Duration testing (timer based)
   - Text questions & answers

Soon to come:

   - Image based questions and answers
   - Jeopardy mode where the answers become the questions
   - Time challenge mode, keep the clock from expiring by answering questions
   - More question sets (it's very nerdy at the moment)
